bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic - in one single test.</p> <p>At the conclusion of the <code>META-GP</code> program, Australia will have a nationally accessible network of laboratories that can apply metagenomic approaches in patient care to rapidly detect, prevent, and respond to infectious threats, including antimicrobial resistance.</p> <p>The <code>META-GP</code> project aligns with the National Microbial Genomics Framework 2019-2022 strategic priorities and principles by delivering the following objectives:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the ability to rapidly identify the cause of any infectious disease within a clinically actionable timeframe and hence transform individual patient care</p> </li> <li> <p>a clear understanding of the range of microbial pathogens that impose a major disease burden in Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>ensure public health surveillance can occur in the face of culture independent diagnostic tests </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":"<p>Williamson Research Group @ The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity</p> <ul> <li>Deborah Williamson</li> <li>Prashanth Ramachandran</li> <li>Marcelina Krysiak</li> <li>Chhay Lim</li> <li>George Taiaroa</li> <li>Janath Fernando</li> <li>Eike Steinig </li> <li>Kirti Deo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#collaborators","title":"Collaborators","text":""},{"location":"#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<ul> <li>Dr. Eike Steinig -
