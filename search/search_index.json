Platform (Meta-GP) program is a collaboration between Australia\u2019s leading researchers in pathogen genomics and clinical infectious diseases.</p> <p>This metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) study is a transformative approach in accredited microbial diagnostics and patient care because it can be used to detect and characterise all known pathogens - bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic - in one single test.</p> <p>At the conclusion of the <code>META-GP</code> program, Australia will have a nationally accessible network of laboratories that can apply metagenomic approaches in patient care to rapidly detect, prevent, and respond to infectious threats, including antimicrobial resistance.</p> <p>The <code>META-GP</code> project aligns with the National Microbial Genomics Framework 2019-2022 strategic priorities and principles by delivering the following objectives:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the ability to rapidly identify the cause of any infectious disease within a clinically actionable timeframe and hence transform individual patient care</p> </li> <li> <p>a clear understanding of the range of microbial pathogens that impose a major disease burden in Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>ensure public health surveillance can occur in the face of culture independent diagnostic tests </p> </li>
